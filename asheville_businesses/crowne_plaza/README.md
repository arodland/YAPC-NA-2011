## Schedules

Each room will have the schedule for the day printed in a plastic plackard each night. 
Lane (Crowne Plaza sales office) tells me that the system for the printouts is that
the catering administrative assistant needs to be notified of any schedule changes
by 3pm for the following day. The schedules are printed by the hotel night audit 
process around 5am each morning.

Hotel room keys can access the business office and print things 24/7, so if all 
else failed we could print our own "oops, corrected" versions whenever.  :/

Additionally, we may choose to purchase easels and/or white boards for each room. 
Easels are $15/day/easel, white board price unknown so far, Lane (Crowne Plaze) 
is figuring that out for "Jamie." .  --jhannah 20101027
