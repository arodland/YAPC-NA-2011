## Schedules

Each room will have the schedule for the day printed into a plastic plackard 
each morning @ 5am by hotel staff ("night audit"). 
Lane (Crowne Plaza sales office) tells me that the catering administrative assistant 
needs to be notified of any schedule changes by 3pm for the print run for the following morning. 

Hotel room keys can access the business office and print things 24/7, so if all 
else failed we could print our own "oops, corrected" versions whenever. 

Additionally, we may choose to purchase easels and/or white boards for each room. 
Easels are $15/day/easel, white board price unknown so far, Lane (Crowne Plaze) 
is figuring that out for "Jamie." Which Jamie? No one knows.  --jhannah 20101027
