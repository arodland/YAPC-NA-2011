## T-shirts

__Blue Ridge Printing__ - NO, they're a large-format print shop (books, etc)

__Image 420__ - screen printing (t-shirts, the lanyards themselves)

    420 Haywood Rd, Asheville, NC 28806-4260
    (828) 253-9440
    ronda(at)image420(dot)com

Final estimate accepted. See the shirts/ directory for everything. --jhannah 20110614

If we want them to screenprint on the fabric of the lanyards themselves they need to know: 
qty, color, imprint color.

## Lanyards 

For inspiration, here are some really cool lanyards: http://fontsinuse.com/f8-conference-badges/

Erica is sending us 350 lanyards. I need to provide the bottom plastic and the paper printouts. --jhannah 20110614

__Advantage Printing__ - paper inside the lanyards

    438 Haywood Rd, Asheville, NC 28806-4263
    (828) 252-7667

Right next door to Image 420. 350 print run 2-sided is cheapest for single color (black).
If color then it's "a digital run" which is the same amount no matter how many colors.
They said they'd email me an estimate.  --jhannah 20101008

## Schedules

No hard copy entire-conference schedules. Sponsors are being sold "advertising spots" that 
don't mention physical paper.  --jhannah 20101027 per perigrin

Each room will have the schedule for the day printed in a plastic plackard each night. 
See crowne_plaza/README.md "Schedules" for details.
