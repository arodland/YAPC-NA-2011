I've got an email out to joshua(dot)mcadams(at)gmail(dot)com asking for the quantities of sizes
we ended up with for YAPC::NA::2010 as a guideline for getting quotes. --jhannah 20101027

__Blue Ridge Printing__ - NO, they're a large-format print shop (books, etc)

__Image 420__ - screen printing (t-shirts, the lanyards themselves)

    420 Haywood Rd, Asheville, NC 28806-4260
    (828) 253-9440
    rhonda(at)image420(dot)com

In order to quote they need the following information: 
style of shirt, color(s) of shirt, color(s) of ink, size and # of 
printing locations (front breast pocket, back full)?

If we want them to screenprint on the fabric of the lanyards themselves they need to know: 
qty, color, imprint color.

10 business days lead time. So deadline: June 10, 2011.

## Lanyards 

Any sponsor providing lanyards, or do we need to buy them? If we're buying them we could
pay one of the screen printing companies (under t-shirts, above) to print "YAPC::NA::2011" 
on them if someone designs such a thing.   --jhannah 20101027

__Advantage Printing__ - paper inside the lanyards

    438 Haywood Rd, Asheville, NC 28806-4263
    (828) 252-7667

Right next door to Image 420. 350 print run 2-sided is cheapest for single color (black).
If color then it's "a digital run" which is the same amount no matter how many colors.
They said they'd email me an estimate.  --jhannah 20101008

## Schedules

No hard copy entire-conference schedules. Sponsors are being sold "advertising spots" that 
don't mention physical paper.  --jhannah 20101027 per perigrin

Each room will have the schedule for the day printed in a plastic plackard each night. 
See crowne_plaza/README.md "Schedules" for details.
